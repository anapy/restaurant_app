# The  Restaurant Concept!

## The Challenge
The challenge is to build a Full Stack Web app that lets the user order food and drinks from a menu, and notifies them when it's 'ready' for pickup.


### How it behaves:
- The menu have three sections, **foods**, **drinks** and **desserts**.

- The menu comes with a set of deals [the MENU.md file](MENU.md).

- The app stores the menu, order and any stateful information in a database (MySQL).

- The app notifies the user when the food is ready for pickup.

- When browser's refreshed, the session must remain intact - the user and order details persist (in process yet).

- The app must have _some_ tests (in process yet)

- The app uses Typescript.

### The technology
- Docker + Docker-compose
- Node + Express + Typescript
- React + Typescript + SASS
- MySQL
